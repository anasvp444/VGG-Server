VGG16 is a convolutional neural network model proposed by K. Simonyan and A. Zisserman from the University of Oxford in the paper “Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition”. The model achieves 92.7% top-5 test accuracy in ImageNet, which is a dataset of over 14 million images belonging to 1000 classes.

## Getting Started

```
git@github.com:anasvp444/VGG-Server.git
virtualenv env
env\Script\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

### Run in Google colab

Open VGG_16_Server.ipynb and run in Colab
